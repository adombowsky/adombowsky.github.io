I'm Alex, a PhD student in the [Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) department at Duke University, supervised by [David Dunson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KwEOawwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Amy Herring](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pw0lX_8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Previously, I obtained my undergraduate and master's degrees from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/). 

I work on Bayesian clustering methods for complex data with a strong mathematical foundation. Recently, I have focused on **decision theory** and **Bayesian nonparametrics**. 

Outside of statistics, I like trail running, the NYT crossword, playing guitar, and watching the Premier League! 

## Recent News

05/06/2024: I've posted a new paper on arXiv about an application of clustering to medicine: Dombowsky et al. (2024+). [Bayesian Learning of Clinically Meaningful Sepsis Phenotypes in Northern Tanzania](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01746). Code to implement the simulation study can be found [here](https://github.com/adombowsky/CLAMR).

01/15/2024: I recieved the SBSS Student Paper Award for "Product Centered Dirichlet Processes for Dependent Clustering" for [JSM 2024 in Portland, OR](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2024/). Looking forward to the conference!

12/12/2023: I've posted a new paper on arXiv about dependent clustering: Dombowsky and Dunson (2023+). [Product Centered Dirichlet Processes for Dependent Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05365). Code is on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/adombowsky/clic).

11/17/2023: I recieved an award for best long talk at [BAYSM 2023](https://events.stat.uconn.edu/BAYSM2023/) for my talk "Bayesian Clustering via Fusing of Localized Densities"!

09/25/2023: I will be speaking as part of an invited session called "Recent Advances in Bayesian Clustering for Complex Data" at the [ISBA 2024 world meeting](https://www.unive.it/web/en/2208/home) in Venice, Italy.
