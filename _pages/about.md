I am a postdoc at [Gladstone Institutes](https://gladstone.org/) in [Barbara Engelhardt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VEGtG7YAAAAJ&hl=en)'s group. My work combines statistics and machine learning to develop probabilistic models and decision-making tools, with a focus on unsupervised learning, graphical models, nonparametric methods, sequential processes, and biomedical applications.

In May 2025, I completed my PhD in Statistical Science at Duke, supervised by [David Dunson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KwEOawwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Amy Herring](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pw0lX_8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Previously, I obtained my master's degree from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/) in Mathematics and Statistics, supervised by [Russell Steele](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-HzKeNwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I was also an undergraduate at McGill, where I received a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. 

Outside of statistics, I like running, the NYT crossword, playing guitar, and watching the Premier League.
