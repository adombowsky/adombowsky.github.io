I'm Alex, a PhD student in the [Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) department at Duke University, supervised by [David Dunson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KwEOawwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Amy Herring](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pw0lX_8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Previously, I obtained my undergraduate and master's degrees from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/). 

I work on Bayesian clustering methods that (1) are robust to **model misspecification**; (2) lead to interpretable, holistic **uncertainty quantification**; and (3) are bolstered by **asymptotic theory**. 

Outside of statistics, I like trail running, the NYT crossword, and playing soccer! 

## Recent News
I've posted a new paper on arXiv! Dombowsky and Dunson (2023+). Bayesian Clustering via Fusing of Localized Densities. [Code is on my Github page](https://github.com/adombowsky/FOLD).
