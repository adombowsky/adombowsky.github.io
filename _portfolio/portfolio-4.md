Recently, I have been interested in developing methods for categorical data with a known (or unknown) graphical dependence structure. The main challenge in this problem is to specify an appropriate prior for the *probability tensor* describing the relationships between features. In "Graphical Modeling of Unordered Categorical Data via Hierarchical Dirichlet Priors" (*working paper*), we introduce the Hierarchical Directed Dirichlet Network (HiDDeN) as one such prior. We establish a framework for posterior computation with HiDDeN and hypothesis testing (e.g., evaluating an edge between nodes).
