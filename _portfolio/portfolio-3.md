Theoretical results on random dot product graphs (RDPGs) have established a central limit theorem for the optimally scaled eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix. However, many of these analyses hinge on the assumption that the average degree of the graph diverges as the number of nodes gets arbitrarily large. In this project, we establish a central limit theorem for the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of a constant degree stochastic block model.
