Recent studies have found that sepsis can be expressed as a spectrum of heterogeneous subtypes and that outcomes can be improved by treatments tailored to each subtype. However, sepsis subtypes have only been identified in cohorts in the USA and Europe. In this project, we derive subtypes within a group of patients from Tanzania, where patients tend to be younger, have been sicker longer, and have a higher prevalence of HIV infection than previous cohorts. We propose a novel Bayesian method for identifying subtypes that incorporates groupings from these previous studies.
